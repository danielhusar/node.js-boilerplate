node.js-boilerplate
===================

My boilerplate for node js.

Includes:
  - express framework
  - less css for css rendering
  - swig as templating engine
  - node.packer for packing js files

Responsive design with predefined less functions.
Javascript functions for code runned only for predefined device.
Very simple MVC logic.

Please run npm install to install all dependencies.

Most frontend stuff comes from: [HTML5 boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/)
