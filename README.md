node.js-boilerplate
===================

My boilerplate for node js.

Includes:
  - express framework
  - less css for css rendering
  - swig as templating engine
  - node.packer for packing js files

Responsive design with predefined less functions.

Please run npm install to install all dependencies.

Most frontend stuff comes from: [HTML5 boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/)
